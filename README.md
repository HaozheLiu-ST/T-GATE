## Quick Introduction

> We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%–50%.

## 📖 Key Observation

![](./assets/observation.png)

>  Impact of cross-attention on the inference steps in a pre-trained diffusion model (SD-2.1). The images generated by the diffusion model at different denoising steps. The first row feeds the text embedding to the cross-attention modules for all steps. The second row only uses the text embedding from the first step to the 10th step, and the third row inputs the text embedding from the 11th to the 25th step.

We summarize our observations as follows:

* Cross-attention converges early during inference, which can be characterized by a semantics-planning and a fidelity-improving phases. The impact of cross-attention is not uniform in these two phases.

* Cross-attention in the semantics-planning phase is significant for generating semantics aligned with the text conditions

* The fidelity-improving phase mainly improves the image quality without requiring cross-attention. FID scores can be slightly improved via null-text embedding in this phase.

## 🖊️ Method

* Step 1: TGATE caches the attention outcomes from the semantics-planning phase.
```
if gate_step == cur_step:
    hidden_uncond, hidden_pred_text = hidden_states.chunk(2)
    cache = (hidden_uncond + hidden_pred_text ) / 2
```

* Step 2: TGATE reuses the self attention throughout the semantics-planning phase.

```
if self_attn and (gate_step>cur_step):
    hidden_states = cache
```

* Step 3: TGATE reuses the cross attention throughout the fidelity-improving phase.

```
if cross_attn and (gate_step<cur_step):
    hidden_states = cache
```
